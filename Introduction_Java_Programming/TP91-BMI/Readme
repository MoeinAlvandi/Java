Computing Body Mass Index
You can use nested if statements to write a program that interprets body mass index.
 Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of health based on height and weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in 
meters. The interpretation of BMI for people 20 years or older is as follows:

BMI Interpretation
BMI 6 18.5 Underweight
18.5 … BMI 6 25.0 Normal
25.0 … BMI 6 30.0 Overweight
30.0 … BMI Obese

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and 
displays the BMI. Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms, and one inch is 0.0254
meters. Listing 3.4 gives the program.
